  Since 2013, the [Open Government Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/open)
  has published an immense amount of data collected by various agencies.
  Unfortunately, the format of the data was never specified so most agencies
  just do a raw or CVS dump of years of data. The first step in our mission is
  to normalize some of the more interesting datasets into a format that can
  be easily accessed and queried. If you are interested in API access to the
  full set of our normalized data, please contact us!
